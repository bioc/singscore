\description{
A GeneSet object that contains the down-regulated genes of the TGFb-induced
EMT gene signature that was derived by (Foroutan et al,2017), using two
meta-analysis techniques. The gene signature contains an up-regulated gene
set (up-set) and a down-regulated gene set (down-set). Please refer to the
vignettes for the steps to acquire the exact data object.
